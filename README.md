# Cigarette-Smoking-Among-American-Youth

This was the capstone project that I worked upon during my graduation under the guidance of Dr. Ofir Turel. The project focusses on identifying the leading contributors that cause smoking urges among the high school students, quantifying the amount of nicotine consumed as compared to the lethal dose, and estimating the effect of cigarette smoking on life expectancy. It involves exploring the data available on drug use and related attitudes and beliefs captured as part of the Monitoring the Future (MTF) survey conducted on 8th and 10th-grade students throughout the United States and take actions towards smoking cessation and reduce the spread of drug-culture amongst American youth.

The primary focus of the project is on three crucial metrics â€“ prevalence of cigarette smoking characterized by demographics like age, sex, grade, etc., amount of nicotine consumed by the youth and comparing it with the lethal dose to conclude its fatality, and the effect of long-term cigarette smoking on life expectancy of an individual. This will be achieved with the help of basic machine learning models complemented with visual dashboards for detailed analysis. The classification models will help us accurately measure the importance of each of the underlying contributors based on historical data to classify a person as a smoker or a non-smoker. The visual analysis of data using dashboards and charts will help us unveil the underlying patterns within the youth data and help us make stronger conclusions about the factors that cause smoking urges among individuals.
